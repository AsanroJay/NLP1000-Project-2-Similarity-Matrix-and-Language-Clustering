and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spoke unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have dug for myself in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company and they came to the threshing floor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning at the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning of the egyptians therefore the name of it was called abelmizraim that is the mourning of the egyptians which is beyond the jordan and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession as a burying place from ephron the hittite before mamre and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all who went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will perhaps hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spoke unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are thy servants and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save many people alive now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spoke kindly unto them and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived a hundred and ten years and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon josephs knees and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to abraham to isaac and to jacob and joseph took an oath from the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence so joseph died being a hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
