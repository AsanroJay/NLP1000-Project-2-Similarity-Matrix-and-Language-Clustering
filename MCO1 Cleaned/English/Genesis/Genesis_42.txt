now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt go down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest perhaps mischief befall him and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those who came for the famine was in the land of canaan and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was who sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth and joseph saw his brethren and he recognized them but made himself as a stranger unto them and spoke roughly unto them and he said unto them from whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye have come and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food have thy servants come we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye have come and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more and joseph said unto them that is it that i spoke unto you saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be tested by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence unless your youngest brother come hither send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be tested whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies and he put them all together into custody three days and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the prison house go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore has this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spoke i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spoke unto them by an interpreter and he turned himself away from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender at the inn he espied his money for behold it was in the mouth of his sack and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell them saying the man who is the lord of the land spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies we are twelve brethren sons of our father one is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are not spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is no more and simeon is no more and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me and reuben spoke unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
