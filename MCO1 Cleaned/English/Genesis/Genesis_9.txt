and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein and god spoke unto noah and to his sons with him saying and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i do set my rainbow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh and the rainbow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth and the sons of noah who went forth from the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan these are the three sons of noah and from them was the whole earth overspread and noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were turned away and they saw not their fathers nakedness and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died
