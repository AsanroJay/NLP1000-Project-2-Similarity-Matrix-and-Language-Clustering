and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh who were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine and thy issue whom thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance and as for me when i came from padan rachel died beside me in the land of canaan on the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there on the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them now the eyes of israel were dim with age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shown me also thy seed and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who fed me all my life long unto this day the angel who redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow
