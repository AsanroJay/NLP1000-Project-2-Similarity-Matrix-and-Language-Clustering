then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place and jacob said unto them my brethren from whence be ye and they said of haran are we and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them and they said we cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and until they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep and while he yet spoke with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leah was tendereyed but rachel was beautiful and wellfavored and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for her and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for a handmaid and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel why then hast thou beguiled me and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn fulfill her week and we will give thee this other also for which service thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter for a wife also and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren and leah conceived and bore a son and she called his name reuben that is see a son for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me and she conceived again and bore a son and said because the lord hath heard that i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon that is hearing and she conceived again and bore a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have borne him three sons therefore was his name called levi that is joined and she conceived again and bore a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah that is praise and ceased bearing
