and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and from that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me and ye know that with all my power i have served your father and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god did not suffer him to hurt me if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the animals bore speckled and if he said thus the ringstreaked shall be thy hire then all the animals bore ringstreaked thus god hath taken away the flocks of your father and given them to me and it came to pass at the time that the animals conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the animals were ringstreaked speckled and grizzled and the angel of god spoke unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the animals are ringstreaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee i am the god of bethel where thou anointed the pillar and where thou vowed a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house are we not counted by him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels and he carried away all his flocks and all his goods which he had gotten the flocks of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her fathers and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount of gilead and it was told laban on the third day that jacob had fled and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him on the mount of gilead and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent on the mount and laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of gilead and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword why didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with taboret and with harp and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spoke unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad and now though thou wouldest be gone because thou sorely longed after thy fathers house yet why hast thou stolen my gods and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said perhaps thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it with thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels saddle and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images and jacob was wroth and chided laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me whereas thou hast searched all my goods what hast thou found of all thy household things set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge between us both these twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten that which was torn by beasts i brought not unto thee i bore the loss of it from my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flocks and thou hast changed my wages ten times unless the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou would have sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these flocks are my flocks and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children whom they have borne now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be a witness between me and thee and jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made a heap and they ate there upon the heap and laban called it jegarsahadutha that is the heap of witness but jacob called it galeed and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed and mizpah that is a beacon or watchtower for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters no man is with ussee god is witness between me and thee and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast between me and thee this heap is a witness and this pillar is a witness that i will not pass beyond this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass beyond this heap and this pillar unto me for harm the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us and jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they ate bread and tarried all night on the mount and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place
