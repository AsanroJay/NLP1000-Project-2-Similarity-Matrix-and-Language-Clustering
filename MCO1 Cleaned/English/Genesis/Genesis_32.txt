and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and he called the name of that place mahanaim that is two hosts or camps and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands and he said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord who saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shown unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i have become two bands deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that same night and took from that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother two hundred shegoats and twenty hegoats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milk camels with their colts forty cows and ten bulls twenty sheasses and ten foals and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by itself and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space between drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee then thou shalt say they are thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us and so commanded he the second and the third and all who followed the droves saying in this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the presents that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face perhaps he will accept me so went the presents over before him and he himself lodged that night in the company and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over what he had and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when the man saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and the man said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go unless thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said why is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place peniel that is the face of god for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he limped upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank
