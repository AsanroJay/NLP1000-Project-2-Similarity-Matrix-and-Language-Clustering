and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven wellfavored cows and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river illfavored and leanfleshed and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river and the illfavored and leanfleshed cows ate up the seven wellfavored and fat cows so pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good and behold seven thin ears blasted with the east wind sprang up after them and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh then spoke the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me under guard in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief baker and we dreamed a dream one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was there with us a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven cows fatfleshed and wellfavored and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other cows came up after them poor and very illfavored and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness and the lean and the illfavored cows ate up the first seven fat cows and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still illfavored as at the beginning so i awoke and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprang up after them and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me and joseph said unto pharaoh the dreams of pharaoh are one god hath shown pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good cows are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dreams are one and the seven thin and illfavored cows that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he showeth unto pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous and for that the dream was repeated unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up a fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be for store for the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine and the counsel was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said unto joseph inasmuch as god hath shown thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him for a wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left off numbering for it was without number and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bore unto him and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh that is forgetting for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house and the name of the second called he ephraim that is fruitful for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction and the seven years of plenteousness which were in the land of egypt were ended and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt and all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy corn because the famine was so sore in all lands
