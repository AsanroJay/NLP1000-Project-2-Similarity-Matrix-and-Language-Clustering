now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them if thou buy a hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he was married then his wife shall go out with him if his master has given him a wife and she has borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him for ever and if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant she shall not go out as the menservants do if she please not her master who hath betrothed her to himself then shall he let her be redeemed to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her and if he has betrothed her unto his son he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters if he take for himself another wife her food her raiment and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish and if he does not do these three unto her then shall she go out free without money he that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death and if a man lie not in wait but god deliver him into his hand then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die and he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death and he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he shall be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death and he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death and if men strive together and one smite another with a stone or with his fist and he die not but keepeth to his bed if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff then shall he that smote him be acquitted he shall only pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed and if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod and he die under his hand he shall be surely punished notwithstanding if he continue a day or two he shall not be punished for he is his money if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no misfortune follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine and if any misfortune follow then thou shalt give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe and if a man smite the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid that it perish he shall let him go free for his eyes sake and if he smite out his manservants tooth or his maidservants tooth he shall let him go free for his tooths sake if an ox gore a man or a woman so that they die then the ox shall be surely stoned and his flesh shall not be eaten but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted but if the ox were wont to push with his horn in times past and it hath been testified to his owner and he hath not kept him in so that he hath killed a man or a woman the ox shall be stoned and his owner also shall be put to death if there be laid on him a sum of money then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him whether he hath gored a son or hath gored a daughter according to this judgment shall it be done unto him if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox shall be stoned and if a man shall open a pit or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it and an ox or an ass fall therein the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto the owner of them and the dead beast shall be his and if one mans ox hurt anothers so that he die then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money from it and the dead ox also they shall divide or if it be known that the ox used to push in times past and his owner hath not kept him in he shall surely pay ox for ox and the dead shall be his own
