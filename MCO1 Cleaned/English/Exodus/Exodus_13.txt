and the lord spoke unto moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten this day came ye out in the month abib and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters and thou shalt show thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt and it shall be as a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lord s law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he swore unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it to thee that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the womb and every firstling that cometh from a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lord s and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the womb being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem and it shall be as a token upon thine hand and as frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest perhaps the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up by five in a rank out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had strictly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham on the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people
