and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people whom thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i swore unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee on the way and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man put on his ornaments for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by mount horeb and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one who sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was outside the camp and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he had gone into the tabernacle and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses and all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the lord spoke unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he returned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people who are upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen
