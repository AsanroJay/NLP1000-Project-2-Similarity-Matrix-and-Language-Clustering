and there went a man of the house of levi and took for a wife a daughter of levi and the woman conceived and bore a son and when she saw that he was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could no longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the reeds by the rivers brink and his sister stood afar off to learn what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the riverside and when she saw the ark among the reeds she sent her maid to fetch it and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the childs mother and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses that is drawn out and she said because i drew him out of the water and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting a hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong why smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killed the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye have come so soon today and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter and she bore him a son and he called his name gershom that is a stranger there for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god took heed of them
