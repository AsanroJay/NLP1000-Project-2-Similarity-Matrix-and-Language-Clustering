and the lord spoke unto moses on mount sinai saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger who sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession and if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor or buyest aught of thy neighbors hand ye shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy from thy neighbor and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy god for i am the lord your god therefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land if thy brother waxeth poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold and if the man have none to redeem it and he himself is able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession but if he is not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee and in the jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it and if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubilee but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubilee notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time and if a man purchase from the levites then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubilee for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession and if thy brother be waxed poor and hath fallen into ruin with thee then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee take thou no interest from him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest nor lend him thy victuals for increase i am the lord your god who brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god and if thy brother who dwelleth by thee be waxed poor and is sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return for they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen thou shalt not rule over him with rigor but shalt fear thy god both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids whom thou shalt have shall be of the heathen who are round about you from them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you from them shall ye buy and from their families who are with you whom they begot in your land and they shall be your possession and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigor and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother who dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the strangers family after he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him either his uncle or his uncles son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he is able he may redeem himself and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee then he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight and if he is not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubilee both he and his children with him for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
