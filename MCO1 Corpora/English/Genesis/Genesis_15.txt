1 After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, “Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.”
2 And Abram said, “Lord God , what wilt Thou give me, seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?”
3 And Abram said, “Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed; and lo, one born in my house is mine heir.”
4 And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, “This shall not be thine heir, but he that shall come forth out of thine own loins shall be thine heir.”
5 And He brought him forth outdoors and said, “Look now toward heaven and count the stars, if thou be able to number them.” And He said unto him, “So shall thy seed be.”
6 And he believed in the Lord ; and He accounted it to him for righteousness.
7 And He said unto him, “I am the Lord who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.”
8 And he said, “Lord God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?”
9 And He said unto him, “Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a shegoat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
10 And he took unto Him all these, and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another; but the birds divided he not.
11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13 And He said unto Abram, “Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.
14 And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried at a good old age.
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.”
17 And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp passed between those pieces.
18 On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the River Euphrates:
19 the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites,
20 and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim,
21 and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
